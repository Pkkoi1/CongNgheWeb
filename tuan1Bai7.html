                A smile is a facial expression formed primarily by flexing the muscles at the
                                        sides of the mouth. Some smiles include a contraction of the muscles at the
                                        corner of the eyes, an action known as a Duchenne smile. Among humans, a smile
                                        expresses delight, sociability, happiness, joy, or amusement.
